# Surfs Up Challenge

## Overview

In this analysis we are comparing seasonal differences in temperature trends to determine whether the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. We are looking at temperature statistics in June and December and will help us to determine if the surfcream shop will be viable year-round or if it's more of a seasonal business. 

## Results

The query results for both June and December show small temperature variation between the months. June's mean temperature is 74.9 degrees while December's was 71.0 degrees. Max and min temps are also surprisingly close with June's range being 64-85 degrees and December's range being 56-83. December's temperatures appear to vary slightly more with a standard deviation of 3.75 degrees vs. June with 3.26 degrees.
